 In my free time, I enjoy hiking and writing. Iâ€™m an avid fan of Khalil Fong, an exceptional artist and musician. 
 I also play in a band called 'ANS' with my friends. I am interested in cognitive science, cosmology, and metaphysics, with a particular focus on exploring the interconnections between their underlying principles.

I am an incoming Ph.D. student in Computer Science at HKUST, where I will work with Prof. [Junxian He](https://jxhe.github.io/). Currently, I am a third-year master student of Computer Science and Technology at Zhejiang University advised by Prof. [Yang Yang](http://yangy.org/) and Prof. [Jiarong Xu](https://galina0217.github.io/). 
I also work closely with Prof. [Carl Yang](https://www.cs.emory.edu/~jyang71/). 
Before that, I received my bachelor degree in Computer Science from Zhejiang University. 

My current research interest primarily lies in machine learning and exploring the capability boundaries of large language models (LLMs).
I am also interested in graph data mining and its specialized applications in real-world scenarios.
