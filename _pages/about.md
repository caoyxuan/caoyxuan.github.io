 In my free time, I enjoy hiking and writing. Iâ€™m an avid fan of Khalil Fong, an exceptional artist and musician. 
 I also play in a band called 'ANS' with my friends. I am interested in cognitive science, cosmology, and metaphysics, with a particular focus on exploring the interconnections between their underlying principles.

I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at [HKUST](https://hkust.edu.hk/zh-hant), supervised by Prof. [Junxian He](https://jxhe.github.io/). Before that, I got my masters' degree in Computer Science and Technology Department at Zhejiang University, advised by Prof. [Yang Yang](http://yangy.org/) and Prof. [Jiarong Xu](https://galina0217.github.io/). 
I also collaborated with Prof. [Carl Yang](https://www.cs.emory.edu/~jyang71/) on various aspects of graph-related research topics. 

My current research interest primarily lies in LLM post-training and LLM reasoning.
I am also interested in graph data mining and its specialized applications in real-world scenarios.
