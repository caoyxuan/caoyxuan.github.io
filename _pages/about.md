Hello, I am a third-year master student of Computer Science and Technology at Zhejiang University advised by [Prof. Yang Yang](http://yangy.org/) and [Prof. Jiarong Xu](https://galina0217.github.io/). I also work closely with [Prof. Carl Yang](https://www.cs.emory.edu/~jyang71/). 
I am an incoming Ph.D. student in Computer Science at HKUST, where I will work with [Prof. Junxian He](https://jxhe.github.io/). Before that, I received the bachelor degree in Computer Science in Zhejiang University in 2022. 

My research interest lies in exploring the knowledge boundaries of large language models (LLMs).

My previous research focus on data-centric machine learning and graph foundation models.
I am interested in understanding and leveraging the relationships between people in real-world society.
